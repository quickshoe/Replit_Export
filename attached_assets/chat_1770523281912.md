# Replit-Export-Tool

## User — 3:46 pm, Feb 03, 2026

Build a Node.js tool called “replit-agent-exporter” that exports my Replit Agent chat history + checkpoint metadata.

Requirements:

Runs locally (Node 18+). Provide clear run steps.
Uses Playwright to automate login + navigation (assume I will login manually in the opened browser window to avoid storing passwords).
After login, the tool:
Lets me paste a list of Replit App URLs (or repl IDs).
For each app, opens the Agent tab and loads the full chat history (auto-scroll until no more content).
Extracts all chat messages (user + agent) with timestamps if present.
Extracts checkpoint entries including:
checkpoint timestamp
checkpoint description
checkpoint cost (the $ amount shown in the UI)
Output:
JSON file per app: ./exports/{replId}.json
One combined CSV: ./exports/all-events.csv
Derive a “duration_seconds” for each checkpoint:
Find the nearest preceding user message timestamp and compute delta.
If timestamps are missing for messages, leave duration blank.
Security:
Do not store my password.
Store only Playwright session state in a local file I can delete.
Provide a “dry run” mode that only exports the first app so I can test quickly.

I've run the program on my computer and after I put in the URL of my project:
https://replit.com/t/quickshoe-llc/repls/Replit-Export-Tool
I get taken to a login page for replit again. The software doesn't wait for me to input my credentials, it times out and then no data is processed.

Here is the full output of my terminal from the moment that I synced my replit changes to my github. We need to fix this error that is causing it to fail. We also need to fix two other things:

There seem to be multiple login efforts. When I first login, I use my git authorization to login to replit. Then another login screen pops up, but I click "Continue with GitHub" and the page disappears. Then when the app opens the replit URL to scrape the app chat, I'm prompted again with the Login to Replit (url likely replit.com/login) and I have to click "Continue with github" but this time it finally opens the replit app that I specified.
I want to make sure that when the app scrolls to the top of the chat, it may encounter a "Show previous messages" button. We need to continue clicking this button until no more new chats appear. The button doesn't disappear right away when the start of the chat is reached. It only disappears after a few seconds.

The replit login is much better now, however, after login is completed, I see an error page. It may be that the URL used for login is not correct. A simple replit.com/login URL should be sufficient and then navigate to the app URL after successful login.

It also appears the app is having trouble accessing the agent chat. Here is the status that I see:
Looking for Agent tab...
Trying direct agent URL...
Agent URL navigation timeout, checking if page loaded...
Scrolling to load full chat history...

And then the app get's hung up clicking "Show previous messages". There needs to be a point where this times out and the chat is scraped because I see that the button doesn't disappear when it reaches the beginning of the chat and the app seems to be waiting for something that never happens.

This all sounds great. I just want to clarify the navigation speed issue: When I use the ?tab=agent in the URL, it doesn't actually take me to an agent tab. It shows me the agent on the left side panel and then it shows me the console tab, which doesn't provide any additional context than what the default URL provides. So there seems to be something broken in the agent tab search, but the script works after using ?tab=agent even thought I can't see any change in how the agent panel is displayed. So there's probably something after attempting to switch to the agent tab that is producing the desired result, even thought the ?tab=agent part of the URL only opens the console tab.

Furthermore, there is no agent panel in replit. It may have been an option in the past, but now I only see the agent chat in the left side panel. Some users may have their agent panel set to the right side.

This is great. We're getting closer with every step. Here are the outputs from the last run attached. You'll see that we need to improve the storage of data in the files, particularly agent-usage-details.csv.

If we expand "Checkpoint made XX... ago" in the chat, then you will find a timestamp. So we don't need to store "Checkpoint made XX..." but we do want to store the timestamp under the timestamp heading in our csv files. We don't need to store "Rollback here", or "Preview", which are also shown under "Checkpoint made..." expanded heading.

You'll see in agent-usage-details.csv that lineItemLabel is a concatenation of the data under the expanded "Worked for XX..." heading. We don't want to capture this information here. We want to expand "Worked for XX..." and then expand "Agent Usage" (you'll see a chevron to expand it), and then capture line for line each description and charge under the expanded Agent Usage heading, excluding the Agent Usage line itself.

## User — 4:17 pm, Feb 07, 2026

Yeah, you got it! And for clarity, in work-tracking, let's make individual columns for:
Time worked - this could replace duration that currently lists "Worked for ..." and will be cleaner showing only the time without "Worked for"
Work done (actions) - store the entry without the word "actions"
Items read (lines) - store without "lines"
Code changed+
Code changed-
Agent Usage(currency) - store without the currency symbol

Apply the same philosophy to the agent-usage-details file, but specific to the lines under the agent usage heading

In the all-events file, I'd like to capture the timestamp. Do we need to capture the "worked for..." information since we're capturing the details in the other files? I'd still like to have the ability to line up the usage with the chats in all-events, but perhaps this is done by sorting through the timestamps. Furthermore, there's a lot of unneeded information in all-events. Perhaps we want a cleaned up chat document that only contains the ID, message type (no checkpoints), and actual chat messages with none of the "Worked for..." or other superfluous text.

Lastly, the ID in the files and filenames isn't very helpful. I see t-quickshoe-llc, but it would be more helpful to see the URL without the replit.com part.

I don't want to see the full URL path, just the part after /repls/. And apply it consistently across files and filenames

Timestamp should always be the column after replId for consistency between files

## Agent — 4:20 pm, Feb 07, 2026

Got it - just the repl name after /repls/ (e.g., Replit-Export-Tool), used consistently for both file content and filenames. And timestamp always comes right after replId in every CSV.

Even though we have a chat.csv capture now, I'd still like to capture "All events" in a .csv as we were doing before.

We aren't successfully capturing the timestamp, which is provided when expanding "Checkpoint made..."

And we aren't successfully capturing the agent usage details, which are provided when expanding "Worked for..." and then "Agent Usage". We are only capturing the total, and I'd like to capture the description and amount for each line under the "Agent Usage" expanded heading. We can remove the "totalAgentUsage" column since this doesn't correlate to the lines under the heading and may be creating confusion when choosing which lines to include.

Work-tracking.csv looks great, except for the missing timestamp, which is the same problem for all 3 files.

Let's also add some debug logging for the agent identification so we can speed up the processing. Here is what I'm seeing in the terminal:
Navigating to: https://replit.com/t/quickshoe-llc/repls/Replit-Export-Tool
Initial navigation timeout, checking if page loaded...
Scrolling to load full chat history...

The initial navigation is timing out whatever is happening in the initial navigation is unsuccessful. The success is happening from the "Checking if page loaded...", so let's go straight to whatever action is successful in that case.

## Agent — 4 days ago

Good points. Let me also address the navigation timeout issue. The tool is trying waitUntil: 'networkidle' with a 60-second timeout, which is failing because Replit's IDE never truly becomes "network idle" - it has constant WebSocket connections. The fallback ("checking if page loaded") works because it just continues anyway. So we should switch to waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' which is faster and sufficient.

Here's my updated plan incorporating all the feedback:

Navigation fix: Replace networkidle with domcontentloaded so we don't waste 60 seconds on a timeout that always fails.

Timestamp fix: The issue is that the timestamp regex captures the relative time (e.g., "4 days ago"), but then the cleaning step strips it from cleanedText - and since timestamp is captured from rawText using the same regex, it should work. Looking more carefully at the code, the problem is likely that the timestamp regex only matches at the end/start of rawText, but the relative time might be embedded mid-string in the DOM text. I'll make the capture more robust and also add debug logging.

Agent Usage details: The current scanning logic isn't finding individual items. I'll add HTML dumping of expanded Agent Usage sections to the debug output so you can see the actual DOM structure on your next run, and I'll broaden the scanning patterns.

All-events CSV: Re-add it.

Debug logging: Add more terminal output during scraping so you can see what's happening.

The speed of execution has improved tremendously. However, we're still having issues with the timestamp and the usage details in "agent-usage-details". There are more lines, but they don't correspond to the information below the "Agent usage" heading, they correspond to the information above the "Agent usage" heading. For example, in this last action, here is what I'm seeing under "Worked for 10 minuts":

I'd like to capture each line after Agent Usage: $4.36 and ignore the lines above it. Let's get this one resolved first of all, then we can work on the other issues.

And as a bit of a nit-picking, let's fix the box display in the terminal. We need to add one space after "Processed: 1 repl(s)" I'm guessing that multiple digit numbers will be inserted between Processed: and repl(s) so that the position of repl(s) doesn't change when going from 1 to 2 digit numbers.
We also need to add two spaces after "Output: ./exports"
Adding these spaces will make sure the right side box aligns

For clarity, I'd like to make sure that we are capturing the actual timestamp shown after the text like saved progress at the end of the loop rather than using the timestamp that we're generating from the relative time description and that we're only falling back on the relative time description, when a timestamp can't be found. However, I don't see a case where the timestamp wouldn't be found below the expanded relative time description

As I watch the scraper perform the tasks, I see that it's not expanding the "Agent Usage", which is why it's not capturing anything. This may be because it can't find the expand button, which is after the "Agent Usage" text and before the usage fee (eg. $1.05) and it may only be looking before the text. Can you make a more robust expand function for "Agent Usage" lines?

And now some timestamps are being capture but most of the timestamps are "XX hours ago" or "XX Days ago" so the expand may be failing in many cases. Or the code is overwriting the actual timestamp with the "... ago" text?

Your first action is to scroll up the top of the chat and click "Show previous message". If you scroll down looking for expand buttons before "Checkpoint made" and "Worked for", then that should expand the main sections and show the timestamp and the work statistics. After every "Worked for" heading, there is a line that says "Agent Usage" with an expand button after it. If you expand that button, then you'll see the usage details.

I can see that you are successfully capturing the chat messages. When you capture the chat messages, can you also capture the carriage returns? This will help with the readability.

## User — 6:58 pm, Feb 07, 2026

For clarity, when you perform the scraping order, you click "Show previous messages" until no more messages appear or timeout. This is working fine so no big changes here. I just want to be sure that you're scrolling down from the first (top) line after that to capture all the expands properly since nested expands occur from top-down.

Good clarification. The "Show previous messages" loop is working fine — no changes there. The key point is that after loading all messages, the expand pass should scroll top-to-bottom so nested expands happen in the correct order (parent sections first, then child sections like "Agent Usage" within them).

Let me update the task list to reflect this more precisely:

I think the walking up after expanding everything is causing us problems. This may be a big change, but we can revert if it doesn't work out. I'd like you to change the strategy from walking up to working down, step by step, line by line:
So the first thing you do is the "Show Previous Message" function that expands the full chat. This is working great right now.

Next, is it possible to search each line for an expand button and capture the text in each line after a section is expanded until the next expand button?

When you expand a line that says "X messages & X actions", there are other action buttons that don't expand and we can ignore those. However, I'd like to capture all the text and all the carriage returns and store them in the chat.csv file. But does .csv allow carriage returns? I suppose that would create a new line, which isn't what we want. Is there another format for the chat that would be more suitable and still display in a readable way? .xml? .html? A format that would be easily readable by a human as well as AI? .pdf?

And as your moving down through the text you will encounter an expand button before "Checkpoint made..." and when you expand that, there will be a line of text and the line right after is the timestamp. After the timestamp are 3 buttons that we can ignore.

And typically after the "Checkpoint" section is the "Worked for..." section with an expand button. After you expand that section, you can store the values in work-tracking.csv. The last line in that section is "Agent Usage" with an expand button immediately after "Agent Usage". The following lines in that section are the lines that belong in agent-usage-details.csv.

The user input usually follows after that. I'm less interested in that timestamp, but I notice if I have the mouse over it, I can see the actual timestamp value.

If you take this step-by-step approach and add information into the JSON and/or .csv files along the way, then the scraping may be more successful.

Decided on Markdown export format (10 seconds)

The user wants a fundamental strategy change - instead of expanding everything first and then walking back up to associate data, they want a top-down, line-by-line approach:

First expand "Show Previous Messages" (already working)
Then walk down the chat line by line
When hitting an expand button, expand it and capture the text until the next expand button
For "X messages & X actions" expansions - capture all text with formatting
For "Checkpoint made..." - expand, get description + timestamp
For "Worked for..." - expand, capture work tracking data, then expand "Agent Usage" within it
User messages follow after

They also ask about CSV format for storing chat with carriage returns - good question. CSV can handle newlines if the field is quoted, but it's messy.

For the export format, Markdown seems like the best choice since it's readable for both humans and AI, handles multiline content naturally, and renders well across different tools and editors.

Great idea on the top-down approach. Walking down line by line and expanding as you go is much more natural — it matches how the content is actually structured in the DOM, and you avoid all the association problems of trying to reconnect data after a bulk expand.

On the CSV + carriage return question: You're right that newlines inside CSV fields are technically allowed (if the field is wrapped in double quotes), but they make the file messy and hard to read in most spreadsheet tools. For the chat export specifically, I'd recommend Markdown (.md). It's:

Easily readable by humans in any text editor
Easily readable by AI/LLMs (it's their native format essentially)
Handles multiline content, code blocks, and formatting naturally
Can render nicely in browsers, VS Code, GitHub, etc.

The chat.md could look something like:

## User — 3:49 pm, Feb 03, 2026

The JSON, work-tracking.csv, and agent-usage-details.csv would stay as they are since they're structured/tabular data that fits CSV well.

All changes are complete and compiling cleanly. Here's a summary of what was done:

Scraper rewrite — The scraping strategy was completely overhauled from a bulk "expand everything then extract" approach to a sequential top-down walk. Each DOM element is now processed one at a time in order:

Timestamps are toggled to absolute first
Collapsed sections (work summaries, agent usage, checkpoints) are expanded as encountered
Data is immediately extracted from each element before moving to the next
A fallback extraction runs if the primary pass finds few results

New Markdown export — A chat.md file is now generated alongside the existing CSV and JSON outputs. It includes:

## User, ## Agent, ## Checkpoint, and ## Work Summary headers with timestamps
All events sorted in original conversation order
System noise filtered out (task lists, publish prompts, etc.)
Multi-line content preserved naturally
