Provide clear run steps.\nUses Playwright to automate login + navigation (assume I will login manually in the opened browser window to avoid storing passwords).\nAfter login, the tool:\n\nLets me paste a list of Replit App URLs (or repl IDs).\nFor each app, opens the Agent tab and loads the full chat history (auto-scroll until no more content).\nExtracts all chat messages (user + agent) with timestamps if present.\nExtracts checkpoint entries including:\n\ncheckpoint timestamp\ncheckpoint description\ncheckpoint cost (the $ amount shown in the UI)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\nJSON file per app: ./exports/{replId}.json\nOne combined CSV: ./exports/all-events.csv\n\n\nDerive a “duration_seconds” for each checkpoint:\n\nFind the nearest preceding user message timestamp and compute delta.\nIf timestamps are missing for messages, leave duration blank.\n\n\nSecurity:\n\nDo not store my password.\nStore only Playwright session state in a local file I can delete.\n\n\nProvide a “dry run” mode that only exports the first app so I can test quickly.\n19 hours ago",
