t-quickshoe-llc,message,user,"Build a Node.js tool called “replit-agent-exporter” that exports my Replit Agent chat history + checkpoint metadata. Requirements:  Runs locally (Node 18+). Provide clear run steps. Uses Playwright to automate login + navigation (assume I will login manually in the opened browser window to avoid storing passwords). After login, the tool:  Lets me paste a list of Replit App URLs (or repl IDs). For each app, opens the Agent tab and loads the full chat history (auto-scroll until no more content). Extracts all chat messages (user + agent) with timestamps if present. Extracts checkpoint entries including:  checkpoint timestamp checkpoint description checkpoint cost (the $ amount shown in the UI)     Output:  JSON file per app: ./exports/{replId}.json One combined CSV: ./exports/all-events.csv   Derive a “duration_seconds” for each checkpoint:  Find the nearest preceding user message timestamp and compute delta. If timestamps are missing for messages, leave duration blank.   Security:  Do not store my password. Store only Playwright session state in a local file I can delete.   Provide a “dry run” mode that only exports the first app so I can test quickly. 19 hours ago",,,,0
