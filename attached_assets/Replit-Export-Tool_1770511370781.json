The login flow requires you to see and interact with the browser.\nFor Replit usage, you'd need to modify the tool to use headless mode with saved credentials or an authentication token, which would change the security model.\n\nMy recommendation: Download this project and run it on your local machine where you can see the browser window, log into Replit, and let the scraper do its work.

So there seems to be something broken in the agent tab search, but the script works after using ?tab=agent even thought I can't see any change in how the agent panel is displayed. So there's probably something after attempting to switch to the agent tab that is producing the desired result, even thought the ?tab=agent part of the URL only opens the console tab.\nFurthermore, there is no agent panel in replit.

So I should skip the tab search entirely and just navigate directly to the repl URL, since the agent chat panel loads automatically.\n\n\nNo separate agent tab: The agent chat lives in a side panel (left or right depending on user settings), not in a separate tab. So we don't need any tab-switching logic at all.\n\n\nHere's my updated approach:\n\nNavigation: Remove the navigateToAgentTab method entirely. Just navigate to the repl URL directly and wait for the page to load. The agent chat panel will already be visible.\nExpand sections: After scrolling to load all history, click every ExpandableFeedContent button to expand the collapsed \"Worked for X\" summaries and \"X messages & X actions\" sections.\nExtract expanded data: Capture detailed work summaries, durations, costs, and charge breakdowns from the now-expanded content.\nOutput files: Populate work-tracking.csv properly and add a new agent-usage-details.csv with individual charge line items.",
