I fixed the bug where new deals weren't getting tasks. The root cause was that stage IDs in your personal template were pointing to the system template stages instead of their own. Does deal creation and stage progression work correctly now?

Everything is looking really good right now.

I'd like to set the default for info boxes for new users. The active defaults should be asking price, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, SDE, cash flow, gross margin and adjusted multiple. EBITDA., EBITDA multiple and SDE multiple should be dissected by default.

I've updated the default settings for new users. Now, info boxes for Asking Price, Revenue, Adj. EBITDA, SDE, Cash Flow, Gross Margin, and Adj. Multiple are active by default, while EBITDA, EBITDA Multiple, and SDE Multiple are set to be dissected. Does this match what you were looking for?

Next, let's go back to the task templates management. Since the templates are being created from seed.TS I want to understand if that is hardcoded or is that being managed by the admin user when the admin user edits, the system task templates

That's a great question and I don't have a great answer. You are right to point out that the admin changes are fragile and in fact, they don't have any purpose if seed.tS is actually controlling the templates for the users. And we also need to take into account how managers will be controlling their company and team templates. There was a reason why we decided to hardcode the stages and tasks into seed.TS rather than have admin template control, but I don't remember what that reason was. Can you look through our chat history and refresh my memory on why we are using seed.TS instead of admin template control?

Unfortunately, I don't have access to our earlier chat history — my memory resets between sessions, so I can only see what's in the current conversation and in the project notes. The scratchpad from the session summary actually has this exact question flagged as unresolved:

"User question: Why was seed.ts chosen over admin template control? (needs chat history review)"

So this question came up before but wasn't answered. Let me check the git history for clues — commit messages from when the template system was built might explain the reasoning.

This is really interesting — the git history actually tells the story of a flip-flop:

Feb 4 — Commit 54f1ea1: Templates were removed from seed.ts with the message "Removes hardcoded task template definitions from seed.ts as they are now managed directly in the database, simplifying the seeding logic and ensuring the database is the single source of truth for templates." — So at that point, the plan was admin/database control.

Feb 5 (the next day) — Commit 09e33d4: That decision was reversed. Templates were put back into seed.ts with the message "Refactor task template management to use a single source of truth in seed.ts, migrating from database-stored seller templates to code-defined entries."

So the direction changed within a day. Let me check if there's more context in that reversal commit about why it was switched back.

Here's what I found in the git history:

There was actually a flip-flop. On Feb 4, templates were removed from seed.ts with the explicit intent that the database (admin control) would be the single source of truth. Then just one day later on Feb 5, that decision was reversed — templates were moved back into seed.ts with the reasoning that it would be a "unified code-first approach" and "single source of truth in code."

The commit messages don't capture a detailed why for the reversal, but based on what was happening at the time, the most likely reason was practical: there was a separate stage_task_templates table being used alongside the newer task_template_entries table, and the seller templates were still partly database-managed while buyer templates were code-defined. The consolidation into seed.ts was probably done to eliminate that inconsistency — getting both buyer and seller templates into the same system rather than having two different management approaches.

So it wasn't necessarily a deliberate architectural preference for code over admin — it was more of a cleanup decision to unify how buyer and seller templates were stored.

The bottom line: There's no strong philosophical reason to keep seed.ts as the authority. It was a pragmatic choice to resolve a split between two template storage systems. Now that the architecture is cleaner, we have the freedom to decide which approach makes more sense going forward.

Given that you also need managers to control team/company templates through the UI, it would make sense to make the database the authority for all template management — with seed.ts only providing initial defaults that get loaded once (and never overwrite manual changes). That way admin edits, manager edits, and personal template edits all work the same way.

Would you like me to plan out that change?
