Replit-Export-Tool,4 days ago,user,"Build a Node.js tool called “replit-agent-exporter” that exports my Replit Agent chat history + checkpoint metadata.  Requirements:  Runs locally (Node 18+). Provide clear run steps. Uses Playwright to automate login + navigation (assume I will login manually in the opened browser window to avoid storing passwords). After login, the tool: Lets me paste a list of Replit App URLs (or repl IDs). For each app, opens the Agent tab and loads the full chat history (auto-scroll until no more content). Extracts all chat messages (user + agent) with timestamps if present. Extracts checkpoint entries including: checkpoint timestamp checkpoint description checkpoint cost (the $ amount shown in the UI) Output: JSON file per app: ./exports/{replId}.json One combined CSV: ./exports/all-events.csv Derive a “duration_seconds” for each checkpoint: Find the nearest preceding user message timestamp and compute delta. If timestamps are missing for messages, leave duration blank. Security: Do not store my password. Store only Playwright session state in a local file I can delete. Provide a “dry run” mode that only exports the first app so I can test quickly."

Replit-Export-Tool,5 hours ago,user,"This all sounds great. I just want to clarify the navigation speed issue: When I use the ?tab=agent in the URL, it doesn't actually take me to an agent tab. It shows me the agent on the left side panel and then it shows me the console tab, which doesn't provide any additional context than what the default URL provides. So there seems to be something broken in the agent tab search, but the script works after using ?tab=agent even thought I can't see any change in how the agent panel is displayed. So there's probably something after attempting to switch to the agent tab that is producing the desired result, even thought the ?tab=agent part of the URL only opens the console tab.  Furthermore, there is no agent panel in replit. It may have been an option in the past, but now I only see the agent chat in the left side panel. Some users may have their agent panel set to the right side."

We're getting closer with every step. Here are the outputs from the last run attached. You'll see that we need to improve the storage of data in the files, particularly agent-usage-details.csv.  If we expand ""Checkpoint made XX... ago"" in the chat, then you will find a timestamp. So we don't need to store ""Checkpoint made XX..."" but we do want to store the timestamp under the timestamp heading in our csv files. We don't need to store ""Rollback here"", or ""Preview"", which are also shown under ""Checkpoint made..."" expanded heading.  You'll see in agent-usage-details.csv that lineItemLabel is a concatenation of the data under the expanded ""Worked for XX..."" heading. We don't want to capture this information here. We want to expand ""Worked for XX..."" and then expand ""Agent Usage"" (you'll see a chevron to expand it), and then capture line for line each description and charge under the expanded Agent Usage heading, excluding the Agent Usage line itself."
Replit-Export-Tool,4 hours ago,user,"Yeah, you got it! And for clarity, in work-tracking, let's make individual columns for: Time worked - this could replace duration that currently lists ""Worked for ..."" and will be cleaner showing only the time without ""Worked for"" Work done (actions) - store the entry without the word ""actions"" Items read (lines) - store without ""lines"" Code changed+ Code changed- Agent Usage(currency) - store without the currency symbol  Apply the same philosophy to the agent-usage-details file, but specific to the lines under the agent usage heading  In the all-events file, I'd like to capture the timestamp. Do we need to capture the ""worked for..."" information since we're capturing the details in the other files? I'd still like to have the ability to line up the usage with the chats in all-events, but perhaps this is done by sorting through the timestamps. Furthermore, there's a lot of unneeded information in all-events. Perhaps we want a cleaned up chat document that only contains the ID, message type (no checkpoints), and actual chat messages with none of the ""Worked for..."" or other superfluous text.  Lastly, the ID in the files and filenames isn't very helpful. I see t-quickshoe-llc, but it would be more helpful to see the URL without the replit.com part."

We aren't successfully capturing the timestamp, which is provided when expanding ""Checkpoint made...""  And we aren't successfully capturing the agent usage details, which are provided when expanding ""Worked for..."" and then ""Agent Usage"". We are only capturing the total, and I'd like to capture the description and amount for each line under the ""Agent Usage"" expanded heading. We can remove the ""totalAgentUsage"" column since this doesn't correlate to the lines under the heading and may be creating confusion when choosing which lines to include.  Work-tracking.csv looks great, except for the missing timestamp, which is the same problem for all 3 files."
Replit-Export-Tool,4 hours ago,user,"Let's also add some debug logging for the agent identification so we can speed up the processing. Here is what I'm seeing in the terminal: Navigating to: https://replit.com/t/quickshoe-llc/repls/Replit-Export-Tool Initial navigation timeout, checking if page loaded... Scrolling to load full chat history...  The initial navigation is timing out whatever is happening in the initial navigation is unsuccessful. The success is happening from the ""Checking if page loaded..."", so let's go straight to whatever action is successful in that case."
Replit-Export-Tool,4 days ago,agent,"Good points. Let me also address the navigation timeout issue. The tool is trying waitUntil: 'networkidle' with a 60-second timeout, which is failing because Replit's IDE never truly becomes ""network idle"" - it has constant WebSocket connections. The fallback (""checking if page loaded"") works because it just continues anyway. So we should switch to waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' which is faster and sufficient.  Here's my updated plan incorporating all the feedback:  Navigation fix: Replace networkidle with domcontentloaded so we don't waste 60 seconds on a timeout that always fails.  Timestamp fix: The issue is that the timestamp regex captures the relative time (e.g., ""4 days ago""), but then the cleaning step strips it from cleanedText - and since timestamp is captured from rawText using the same regex, it should work. Looking more carefully at the code, the problem is likely that the timestamp regex only matches at the end/start of rawText, but the relative time might be embedded mid-string in the DOM text. I'll make the capture more robust and also add debug logging.  Agent Usage details: The current scanning logic isn't finding individual items. I'll add HTML dumping of expanded Agent Usage sections to the debug output so you can see the actual DOM structure on your next run, and I'll broaden the scanning patterns.  All-events CSV: Re-add it.  Debug logging: Add more terminal output during scraping so you can see what's happening."
Replit-Export-Tool,3 hours ago,user,"The speed of execution has improved tremendously. However, we're still having issues with the timestamp and the usage details in ""agent-usage-details"". There are more lines, but they don't correspond to the information below the ""Agent usage"" heading, they correspond to the information above the ""Agent usage"" heading.

Let's get this one resolved first of all, then we can work on the other issues.  And as a bit of a nit-picking, let's fix the box display in the terminal. We need to add one space after ""Processed: 1 repl(s)"" I'm guessing that multiple digit numbers will be inserted between Processed: and repl(s) so that the position of repl(s) doesn't change when going from 1 to 2 digit numbers.

Can you make a more robust expand function for ""Agent Usage"" lines?  And now some timestamps are being capture but most of the timestamps are ""XX hours ago"" or ""XX Days ago"" so the expand may be failing in many cases. Or the code is overwriting the actual timestamp with the ""... ago"" text?  Your first action is to scroll up the top of the chat and click ""Show previous message"". If you scroll down looking for expand buttons before ""Checkpoint made"" and ""Worked for"", then that should expand the main sections and show the timestamp and the work statistics. After every ""Worked for"" heading, there is a line that says ""Agent Usage"" with an expand button after it. If you expand that button, then you'll see the usage details.

Replit-Export-Tool,2 hours ago,agent,"Good clarification. The ""Show previous messages"" loop is working fine — no changes there. The key point is that after loading all messages, the expand pass should scroll top-to-bottom so nested expands happen in the correct order (parent sections first, then child sections like ""Agent Usage"" within them).  Let me update the task list to reflect this more precisely:"
Replit-Export-Tool,1 hour ago,user,"I think the walking up after expanding everything is causing us problems. This may be a big change, but we can revert if it doesn't work out. I'd like you to change the strategy from walking up to working down, step by step, line by line: So the first thing you do is the ""Show Previous Message"" function that expands the full chat. This is working great right now.  Next, is it possible to search each line for an expand button and capture the text in each line after a section is expanded until the next expand button?  When you expand a line that says ""X messages & X actions"", there are other action buttons that don't expand and we can ignore those. However, I'd like to capture all the text and all the carriage returns and store them in the chat.csv file. But does .csv allow carriage returns? I suppose that would create a new line, which isn't what we want. Is there another format for the chat that would be more suitable and still display in a readable way? .xml? .html? A format that would be easily readable by a human as well as AI? .pdf?  And as your moving down through the text you will encounter an expand button before ""Checkpoint made..."" and when you expand that, there will be a line of text and the line right after is the timestamp. After the timestamp are 3 buttons that we can ignore.  And typically after the ""Checkpoint"" section is the ""Worked for..."" section with an expand button. After you expand that section, you can store the values in work-tracking.csv. The last line in that section is ""Agent Usage"" with an expand button immediately after ""Agent Usage"". The following lines in that section are the lines that belong in agent-usage-details.csv.  The user input usually follows after that. I'm less interested in that timestamp, but I notice if I have the mouse over it, I can see the actual timestamp value.  If you take this step-by-step approach and add information into the JSON and/or .csv files along the way, then the scraping may be more successful."
Replit-Export-Tool,"3:26 pm, Feb 07, 2026",user,"agent-usage-details_1770523281912.csv all-events_1770523281912.csv chat_1770523281912.csv chat_1770523281912.md Replit-Export-Tool_1770523281912.json work-tracking_1770523281912.csv  This is awesome! We made a big improvement in the timestamp extraction. work-tracking.csv is pretty complete. However, there's one change I'd like to explore: the text that I see in the agent chat shows something like ""Time worked 6 minuters"", but when I hover over the ""6 minutes"" with my mouse it says ""6 minutes 30 seconds"". Are you able to capture that from the DOM?  I'm also confused as to why some of the lines are out of order; meaning that for example one timestamp shows Feb 03, 2026 between two Feb 07, 2026 lines.  I'm also seeing two duplicate lines that don't have agent usage fees: 3:26 pm, Feb 07, 2026 9 minutes This appears to be from a user input, so why were these lines included when other user input lines were not? To be clear, I'm glad that other user lines are not included, I'm just trying to understand why extra lines and out of order timestamps are in the file.  I'm attaching the output files."
Replit-Export-Tool,44 minutes ago,user,"If the sequential walk is effective, then why run the fallbackExtract? Is it actually finding information that was missed on the first pass or is it only duplicating information?"
Replit-Export-Tool,31 minutes ago,user,"That's excellent. Now, I'd like to produce a work summary from the work tracking document. The work summary will be a sum of each days work. It would be a separate work-summary.csv file. This file would sum each of the metrics for the day: Time worked, Work done (actions), Items read (lines), Code added, Code removed, Agent usage fee. Then it would have one line for each date and show the metrics for that day.  Then the last thing to resolve is why we're not seeing any of the usage details in the agent-usage-details.csv file. I don't see the information in Replit-Export-Tool.json. I see all ""chargeDetails"": []. Perhaps the DOM isn't showing these values in the way we're expecting or perhaps they appear in some other element"
Replit-Export-Tool,28 minutes ago,user,"That human readable total duration is great. I'd also like a column that lists the duration in minutes, as a number only (no ""minutes"" in the field), with the seconds represented as a decimal point."
Replit-Export-Tool,28 minutes ago,agent,"Got it — the work summary will include both a human-readable duration column (e.g., ""2 hours 15 minutes 30 seconds"") and a numeric minutes column (e.g., 135.5) for easy sorting and analysis.  Here's the updated plan:"
Replit-Export-Tool,4 days ago,user,"Great. As I review a few things, I see that you are correct, clicking on the text for ""Agent Usage"" is enough to expand the section and view the details.  In Replit-Export-Tool.json, in the checkpoints section, the time is being smashed with the text to create a description like ""4 days agoTransitioned from Plan to Build mode"". We need a space between ""ago"" and ""Transitioned""; or better yet put "" - "" to show that there is a clear separation of the time and the text."
Replit-Export-Tool,4 days ago,user,"I just want to clarify something: checkpoints already have valid timestamps so we don't need to do anything with the ""4 days ago"". We could remove these extra relative times since they only relate to when the extaction was performed and have no relevance otherwise. Is there any reason not to remove them completely. You say the regex tries to match after ""ago"", but do we need this anymore?"
Replit-Export-Tool,4 days ago,agent,"You're absolutely right. The relative timestamps (""4 days ago"") are just artifacts of when the scrape happened — they have no lasting value since the checkpoints already have proper absolute timestamps. There's no reason to keep them in the description at all.  The simplest fix is to just strip any relative time pattern from the description entirely, rather than trying to separate it with "" - "". That way you get a clean description like ""Transitioned from Plan to Build mode"" instead of ""4 days ago - Transitioned from Plan to Build mode""."
