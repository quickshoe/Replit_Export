So there seems to be something broken in the agent tab search, but the script works after using ?tab=agent even thought I can't see any change in how the agent panel is displayed. So there's probably something after attempting to switch to the agent tab that is producing the desired result, even thought the ?tab=agent part of the URL only opens the console tab.\n\nFurthermore, there is no agent panel in replit.

The tool is trying waitUntil: 'networkidle' with a 60-second timeout, which is failing because Replit's IDE never truly becomes \"network idle\" - it has constant WebSocket connections. The fallback (\"checking if page loaded\") works because it just continues anyway. So we should switch to waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' which is faster and sufficient.\n\nHere's my updated plan incorporating all the feedback:\n\nNavigation fix: Replace networkidle with domcontentloaded so we don't waste 60 seconds on a timeout that always fails.\n\nTimestamp fix: The issue is that the timestamp regex captures the relative time (e.g., \"4 days ago\"), but then the cleaning step strips it from cleanedText - and since timestamp is captured from rawText using the same regex, it should work. Looking more carefully at the code, the problem is likely that the timestamp regex only matches at the end/start of rawText, but the relative time might be embedded mid-string in the DOM text. I'll make the capture more robust and also add debug logging.\n\nAgent Usage details: The current scanning logic isn't finding individual items. I'll add HTML dumping of expanded Agent Usage sections to the debug output so you can see the actual DOM structure on your next run, and I'll broaden the scanning patterns.\n\nAll-events CSV: Re-add it.\n\nDebug logging: Add more terminal output during scraping so you can see what's happening.",

This is working great right now.\n\nNext, is it possible to search each line for an expand button and capture the text in each line after a section is expanded until the next expand button?\n\nWhen you expand a line that says \"X messages & X actions\", there are other action buttons that don't expand and we can ignore those. However, I'd like to capture all the text and all the carriage returns and store them in the chat.csv file. But does .csv allow carriage returns? I suppose that would create a new line, which isn't what we want. Is there another format for the chat that would be more suitable and still display in a readable way? .xml? .html? A format that would be easily readable by a human as well as AI? .pdf?\n\nAnd as your moving down through the text you will encounter an expand button before \"Checkpoint made...\" and when you expand that, there will be a line of text and the line right after is the timestamp. After the timestamp are 3 buttons that we can ignore.\n\nAnd typically after the \"Checkpoint\" section is the \"Worked for...\" section with an expand button. After you expand that section, you can store the values in work-tracking.csv. The last line in that section is \"Agent Usage\" with an expand button immediately after \"Agent Usage\". The following lines in that section are the lines that belong in agent-usage-details.csv.\n\nThe user input usually follows after that. I'm less interested in that timestamp, but I notice if I have the mouse over it, I can see the actual timestamp value.\n\nIf you take this step-by-step approach and add information into the JSON and/or .csv files along the way, then the scraping may be more successful.",
